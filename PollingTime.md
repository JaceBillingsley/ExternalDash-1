# Polling Time
<h3>We highly reccomend that you leave the polling time at 5 or above, but if you wish you can change this intereval</h3>
<br>
<h4>Open the index.js file in an editor, if you dont have one right click on the file and click edit.</h4>
<h4>Next go to line 4 and change the number 5 in 'const pollingInterval = 5;' to whatever intereval you want!</h4>
