# Run Files
<h3>Starting this program uses command promt, so we can automate this with a batch file!</h3>
<br>
<h4>Make a new text file, and put the following code inside of it</h4>
```cd %userprofile%/Desktop/Code/console"
node index.js
```
<h4>Change everything after /Desktop/ to match the directory of where the system files are located</h4>
<h4>Finally go up to the top, and save the file as 'run.sh', and make sure under file type its check to '*', or 'All File Types'</h4>
